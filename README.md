# Data-Structures-Project

Smart Traffic Management System Simulator
This project simulates a smart traffic control system that manages traffic lights based on certain conditions such as traffic density or timer logic. 
The aim is to demonstrate how automation can help manage traffic more efficiently and reduce congestion at intersections.

üö¶ Features
Simulates traffic signals at a four-way intersection

Manages signal timing based on predefined logic
Displays real-time signal changes

Helps understand basic traffic flow control mechanisms

üíª Technologies Used
C++ (console-based program)

Object-Oriented Programming concepts and Data Structures

Basic logic implementation for signal control

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
Extract the ZIP file.

Open the source code in any C++ IDE (CodeBlocks, Dev-C++, VS Code, etc.).

Compile and run main.cpp (or the main file in the project).


Follow on-screen instructions to simulate traffic flow.
